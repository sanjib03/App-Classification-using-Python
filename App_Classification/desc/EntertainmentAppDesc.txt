Starring Johnny Depp as Donald Trump, Patton Oswalt as Merv Griffin, Jack McBrayer as Der Scutt and ALF as himself, this 1988 film never aired, but we’ve unearthed it here for a limited time. Watch it this weekend before it's history.

We’ve completely redesigned the app from the ground up to include videos, articles, pictures, and GIFs, because you need more things to look at on your phone while life passes you by.
