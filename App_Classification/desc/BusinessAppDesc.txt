Frequently Asked Questions
—————————————————————— 

How does this app record calls? 

Take a look at our screenshots for step by step instructions. 

When you're on a call and you want to record it, open TapeACall and press the record button. We will put your call on hold and dial our recording line. As soon as our line answers tap the merge button on your screen to create a 3 way call between your other caller and our recording line. 

If you want to record an outgoing call, just press the record button. The app will dial our recording line and will begin recording as soon as our line answers. Once that happens, tap the add call button on your screen, call the person you want to record, then press the merge button when they answer. 

—————————————————————— 

Can I download recordings to my computer? 

Yes, and we've made it extremely easy to do this. From inside the app you can attach the recording to an email and send it to yourself as an MP3, or you can click the share button and find a short URL that you can type into your computer's browser. 

—————————————————————— 

How many recordings can I make? 

As many as you want! We don't have a limit on the number of recordings you can make.

As long as you want! We don't have a limit on how long your recording can be. You can record for hours if you want.

—————————————————————— 

Are there any additional fees? 

We do NOT charge you any additional fees.  Please keep in mind that 3-way calling will use your airtime minutes. Also, carriers outside the US may charge for long distance calls, so be sure to check if TapeACall is long distance for you. If it is, you may be able to get around this by adding TapeACall's access number as one of your "Fav" numbers so you can call it without additional airtime usage or carriers fees.

Introducing the official dōTERRA shopping and enrollment smartphone app.
This app is the only dōTERRA app in the app store that enables users to untether themselves from a laptop or home computer and securely log into the dōTERRA system.  Imagine having the ability to be in a meeting and enroll someone new right then and there!  Later, while you are at a child’s soccer game, you might create or manage a monthly LRP order.  It’s about convenience and the best use of time.
Of course, you could still go to http://doterra.myvoffice.com  (as always) to login, shop or enroll, but the dōTERRA shopping and enrollment app is designed to be a simpler, more elegant and intuitive experience with the dōTERRA system. 
This app is fully integrated with the dōTERRA back office.  Wellness Advocates in the USA* can use this smartphone app to :
1.Create LRP orders
2.Edit scheduled LRP orders
3.Create standard 1x orders
4.Enroll Wellness Advocates
5.Receive Message Center group or individual messages 
6.View monthly qualification status
Wellness Advocates who already subscribe to the premium features of the dōTERRA back office will also notice they can create and send group or individual messages.
You’ll love having the essential back office functions right there in your pocket, and where ever life takes you!Thumbtack helps you find new customers and grow your business. The process is simple.

RSA SecurID two-factor authentication is based on something you have (a software token installed in the RSA SecurID app) and something you know (an RSA SecurID PIN), providing a more reliable level of user authentication than reusable passwords.

After you install the app, you separately import a software token. With the token installed, the app generates one-time passwords (OTPs). You use your PIN and the current OTP to access protected resources, such as your VPN client. You never need to carry a separate hardware token. 

RSA SecurID administrators can rapidly and securely deploy software tokens to iOS devices. Users can import a token with one tap or by scanning a QR Code. 

Your company must have:
• RSA Authentication Manager or the RSA SecurID Authentication Engine API for software token provisioning and user authentication
• RSA SecurID Software Token seedsOnavo Protect helps keep you and your data safe when you browse and share information on the web.
