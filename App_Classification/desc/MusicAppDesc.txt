PRAISE FOR SOUNDCLOUD
 
“SoundCloud is focused on building out a massive trove of content, weaving it all into the Web and making it easier to share. The “YouTube for audio” analogy looks increasingly apt, especially if its metrics continue to shoot skyward.” - ReadWrite
 
“SoundCloud is a sharing machine. Remember the early days of audio online — when you had to download the Real Player or Windows Media Player to listen? The days of downloading before listening are over.” - USA Today
 
“It's an evolution of audio's most vital self-service creation and discovery platform, music's best analogue to Twitter, YouTube, and Kindle Direct Publishing. It's not just finding or sharing songs or podcasts or spoken-word readings your friends may be listening to — it's finding and sharing the people who make those recordings, too.” - The Verge

Drum Kit is the fastest and most realistic drum app in the App Store. As featured on Apple iPod Touch billboards and TV ads.

Check out Drum Kit in Ke$ha's video Die Young: http://www.youtube.com/user/drumkitapp.

Play along to songs in your iPod Library and record your own versions of them. Layer tracks on top of each other, such as adding cymbals and fills to your existing songs. You can also create your own original songs.

Drum Kit is the perfect app for cranking out that fill for the punchline for lame jokes. But it offers much, much more.

The audio engine in Drum Kit has been designed to provide the fastest possible response on all devices. The latest version has no delay or latency when playing drums. It's impossible to make a faster drum app.

"If you are a drummer or constantly tapping on things, you may really enjoy this app" -Ars Technica

"You know those beats you have always found to be missing in your favorite song? Well, you can make it happen now" – Katie Gatto, bestappleapps.com

If you like Drum Kit, check out Drum Kit 2. It lets you play along to MIDI songs and keep score, like RockBand or Guitar Hero. Search the App Store for "Drum Kit 2".

- 6 piece kit (4 toms, snare, bass, hi-hat (open and closed), crash, ride, splash)
- Acoustic, Electronic, and Industrial themes
- Five different kits: Classic, Rock, Hip Hop, Techno, Dance

- You can play on top of a track while it's playing for multi-track recording
- Use the metronome and count-in for easier recording

HOW TO PLAY ROLLS:
You can now slide your fingers across Drum Kit to play rolls. Turn on rolls in Settings and change the BPM (beats per minute) to fine tune your rolls. Try sliding in a circle around toms and snare for instance.

Includes multi-track recording, iPod library access to play along to songs, metronome, count-in, left-hand mode, rolls and BPM support.
