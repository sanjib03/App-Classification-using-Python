SEARCH BY KEYWORD OR CHAPTER

“The new Foursquare, like Netflix, takes a lot of the work out of finding the right thing for the right moment.” — The Verge

How It Works:

Tell Foursquare what you like — be specific, like “craft beer” or “fried chicken,” or more general, like “outdoor seating” or “romantic places.” Every search is tailored to your tastes, your past ratings, and picks from friends and experts you trust.

A note on battery –
We've spent years developing the location technology that powers Foursquare, making it extremely power efficient. But, as with all apps of this type, please note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.Your iPhone can now feed you. No, your phone hasn’t learned to cook but you won’t have to either, thanks to the free, easy-to-use Yelp Eat24 Order Food Delivery & Takeout app.

Order food delivery from over 30,000 restaurants in 1,500+ cities, with more being added each day. Search 24 hours a day from wherever you are, or wherever you’re going to be when you’re ready for some food. The Yelp Eat24 app remembers your preferences, which saves you time, and gives you coupons on a regular basis, which saves you money. Oh, and because 24 is in our name, that means you can definitely order 24 appetizers for yourself and not feel the least bit bad about it. At least we're pretty sure that's how it works.

What can our app do?
- Search for specific cuisines, restaurants...even particular dishes.

- It has Yelp inside. See what the foodies of Yelp think about a restaurant without leaving the app.

- Eye Candy. Eat with your eyes and browse delicious food photos on the restaurant menu page. As if you weren’t hungry enough already.

- In unfamiliar territory? Search by your current location, order, and the Yelp Eat24 app will have it waiting (well, really the restaurant will, but you get the idea).

- Like to play favorites? We understand completely (Mom always liked us best). The Yelp Eat24 app lets you save your favorite restaurants so you can find them more easily next time.

- Do you enjoy entering your credit card numbers over and over again? That’s a rhetorical question, no one does. Which is why the Yelp Eat24 app lets you scan your credit card directly into the app and securely stores your payment information for you.

- Hate credit cards? Use Apple Pay or PayPal!

- 24 Hour Live chat and order status support. If it isn’t right, we’ll make it right. No robots, no problem.

- Cash back for future orders through our CashCoupon rewards system.

- Exclusive offers and content through our Eat24Hours VIP program.

- Take pictures of your food and capture the memory of your meal before you devour it. Because a picture is worth 1,000 yums, and because they make other people jealous and hungry. (And really, isn’t that the point of taking food photos?)

- Yelp Eat24 Notes. Write a note about your meal right on your phone and remind yourself to order/not order an item again. (Because hunger affects memory in mysterious ways)

- We added the popular Tweet My Meal function, because everyone knows that if you didn’t tweet about it, it didn’t actually happen.

Best of all, once your order’s in, Yelp Eat24 handles every aspect of the delivery experience. Which means no more screwed-up orders. No more wondering where the delivery driver is. Just the ability to take back a few precious minutes of your day and enjoy. Something not quite right? Hit up our 24 Hours Live Support within the app and chat with a real human being about any issue or question you may have. We’ll make things right.

Macworld: **** (4 mice)
“A tool that can remind me where to find great crab cakes and help me avoid another bland meal
at an interchangeable chain restaurant? Yeah, that’s earned a place on my iPhone.”
CNet: **** (4 stars, editor review)
“If you're truly looking for a unique dining experience in a U.S. metropolitan area, you'd do well
to try LocalEats.”

LocalEats is an authoritative dining guide based on a formula that works. We’ll point you to the
best steak houses, the best sushi spots, and the best burger joints, plus all the other “bests,” all
over the country.

Our editors consider ratings from magazines, newspapers, and dining sites along with
suggestions from locals, top food bloggers, and their own personal dining experiences to pick
and choose the restaurants travelers should know about. The result is the best curated lists
containing the best restaurants, including the best offbeat local finds, wherever you are in the
U.S.

We won’t list every restaurant – let’s be honest, you can walk down the street or do a Google
search and find just any restaurant. If we list a restaurant, you know it’s good. Or simply, as we
like to say, LocalEats has done all the research for you.

We’ll show you the Top 100 picks by city, hundreds of other local favorites, dining savings,
menus and more. Filter restaurants by cuisine, neighborhood, features, price range and hours.

Application features:

• LocalEats features the best independently owned restaurants across the U.S., plus 50
international cities.
• NO NATIONAL CHAIN RESTAURANTS — Local places only!
• Quickly see what's “near me” via GPS and customize your own search radius
• Find restaurants near a particular address, city or even landmarks.

• See restaurant menus.
• Make reservations quickly
• Book a taxi instantly
• Filter restaurants by Top 100, All Picks, Cuisine, Neighborhood, Feature, Savings, Price
Range, Hours, Bar Information, Patio Seating, Vegetarian Friendly, etc …
• Driving directions
• Integrated mapping (view results via list or map with pop-up dialogue)
• Detailed descriptions

• Save your "Favorite" restaurants and cities
• Share your favorite restaurants with friends

NOTE TO IPOD TOUCH USERS: Because iPods are not GPS enabled, "near me" searches
will not work unless you are using WiFi. Also in some remote areas, your position still may not
be found even with WiFi. Instead, you may search for restaurants near you by turning off "Use
Current Location" and searching by zip code or city.

Washington D.C.Exciting New Version:  Find restaurants graded for cleanliness & satisfaction that are highly recommended.

In seconds, find restaurants with countdown to Instant Find. 3... 2... 1... 0... and the closest restaurants appear, with directions. Find either a graded restaurant, or an ungraded one if nothing is available. Traveling? Perfect! The app will show you how to get there with a tap by opening the default iPhone Maps App. One more tap and view the restaurant's profile.

This app continues to deliver the same inside information on cleanliness, satisfaction, and recommended restaurants as the website but is for those on the go!

Unlike most restaurant-finding apps, DiningGrades offers directed information on these three important ratings of a restaurant, not just its decor, cuisine, or friendly staff.

Through user-comments and a copyrighted scoring system, this app delivers a quick cleanliness, satisfaction and recommendation grades not available elsewhere, nformation that is valuable to a savvy diner.

Once you find your preferred restaurant, display a map, call directly from the profile screen or make reservations on line at thousands of restaurants. 

When finished dining, use the tip calculator and then grade from the table or car by pressing "Yes" for "Are you at the restaurant now?". Type three letters of the restaurant's name. You'll be prompted to answer questions on three elements of the restaurant and be given an opportunity to leave comments for future diners. If you've already driven home, the app will initiate a search to find the restaurant's address and phone number, displaying a list to choose from.

Using Dining Grades, you become an informed diner. You know which restaurants are clean, have satisfied customers and are recommended.

You'll have the ability to spread the word to others about your dining experience or conversely find a highly graded restaurant. This is a grass roots effort. You have a chance to be an anonymous leader in your community.

DiningGrades.com was created by Dr. Harlan Stueven, an emergency room doctor with several decades experience. He witnessed side-effects of dirty dining causing food-borne illnesses. Many linked to poor restaurant hygiene. Impassioned to make a difference, he developed a reporting system that empowers the public to identify restaurants needing improvement.
