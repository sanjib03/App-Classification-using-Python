“I found Game of War – Fire Age more engaging than its closest analogue, Clash of Clans” - NY Times review

5/5 “I love strategic RPG games like this. I first started off with Clash Of Clans and wondered if there was anything as similar to this and found Game Of War. It's easy to get started with and addictive.”

5/5 “This is the best MMO and game ever. I have played other MMO games but this is the best one yet! You can battle other players and collect resources and build really cool buildings. If I had to rate this game it would be 10 stars. But, there is no 10 star rating.”

5/5 “Best real-time Strategy game I have ever played!”

5/5 “If you like games like Boom Beach or Clash of Clans I think you'll like this one!”

Like us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/FoursakenMediaThe Angry Birds are back in the sequel to the biggest mobile game of all time! Angry Birds 2 starts a new era of addictive slingshot gameplay with stunning graphics, challenging multi-stage levels, scheming boss pigs and even more destruction.
 
**Angry Birds 2 is optimized for iPhone 5, iPad 3, iPad mini 2 and iPod Touch 5G or newer. You can try it on older devices, but we can't guarantee a smooth bird flinging experience!
 
CHOOSE YOUR BIRD!
It’s the ultimate slingshot action strategy – YOU choose which bird to fling next! “But that makes it easier, right?” WRONG! You’ll need to choose wisely if you’re going to stop those eggs from getting scrambled. Plus, crush those pigs and blocks to fill up the Destruct-O-Meter and earn extra birds!

NEW MULTI-STAGE LEVELS!
You’ve never seen Piggy Island like this – jaw-droppingly stunning levels brimming with exotic plants, quirky details, fun animations and plenty of peril. Those naughty porkies are now experts at building physics defying towers: levels now have multiple stages for an added challenge. Uh oh.

SPECTACULAR SPELLS!
Blizzards, Hot Chilis, Golden Ducks and other outrageous spells give you an added advantage against those swindling swine. And when you need some serious help, guess who’s at hand to make a pork-smashing cameo? That’s right, it’s the sardine loving Mighty Eagle. Oh yeah!

CHALLENGE OTHER PLAYERS!
Challenge players from across the world in the Arena to see who’s the best bird flinger of them all! Connect to Facebook and play new tournaments every day to earn feathers and level-up your flock. In the Arena you play until you run out of birds and spells, so get out there and solve the puzzles – you’re only up against the rest of the planet.
 
DEFEAT BOSS PIGGIES!
There’s some serious bad guys on Piggy Island, and your slingshot skills are needed to take them down. Foreman Pig, Chef Pig and the infamous King Pig will stop at nothing to keep your eggs. Are you gonna let ‘em get away with that? It’s time to hit that pork and teach ‘em a lesson.

*iPhone 4 devices are not supportedRace for dominance in the first white-knuckle edition of Need for Speed made just for mobile – from the developer that brought you Real Racing 3. 
Build your dream ride with an unbelievable range of cars and customizations. Launch yourself between chaos and control as you hit the loud pedal and roll into underground car culture. Win races, up your rep, then kick into more races, more customizations, and more cars. Make your choices and never look back.

This app offers in app purchases. You may disable in app purchases using your device settings.

CUSTOMIZE EXTREME RIDES
Pick up the real-world cars you’ve always wanted, from the Subaru BRZ to the BMW M4, McLaren 650s, Porsche 911, and more. Then trick them out with the hottest customization system on mobile, from spots like the Mod Shop and the Black Market, giving you over 2.5 million custom combos to play with. Your rides are waiting – take them to the stages or streets to go head-to-head versus the competition and prove yourself.  

DRIVE FAST – AND FEARLESS 
Steer onto the streets of Blackridge, driving reckless and juiced as sparks fly. Accelerate over jumps and around debris, into traffic, against walls, and through high-speed Nitro Zones. Flip on the nitrous and thrust yourself into another level of adrenaline-fueled driving and drifting. Around every corner is a fresh race as you clash with local crews and local cops. It’s a world full of wannabe drivers – can you stay in front and earn respect? 

RACE TO WIN
Never back down as you race anyone crazy enough to take you on, leave them gapped, and increase your rep. Dig, drift, drag, and roll your ride to wins with police on your tail, hitting each inch of the map hard by the time you reach the big end. Burn rubber in over 1,000 challenging races – and that’s just the starting line. Be notorious, own the streets, and score the world’s best cars. Because one ride is never enough!

Riddle Stones is a game of logic that will train your brain: like crosswords but with squares and numbers. The game is based on the asian riddles known as picross, griddler and nonogram. It’s a real mind challenge wrapped in a fun experience where you need to think and use your brains to succeed.

To decipher our puzzle grids, you will use numbers indicating which squares to activate in each grid based on simple rules. Each number tells you where to add squares in a row or a column. You can compare it to sudoku or crosswords with more fun brain training. You will learn easily, progress rapidly and quickly get addicted! It will blow you mind!

Riddle Stones offers a fascinating cross-over between crosswords, sudoku, minesweeper and other puzzles based on numbers where you cross the hints to find which squares to activate. But be careful and think right, if you tap the wrong square, you will trigger a trap!

Fans of picross, nonogram, griddler, paint by numbers rejoice and enjoy Riddle Stones...
