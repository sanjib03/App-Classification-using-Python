Using Google Classroom in school? Get the iOS App to use Classroom on the go.

Classroom helps teachers save time, keep classes organized, and improve communication with students. It is available to anyone with Google Apps for Education, a free suite of productivity tools including Gmail, Drive and Docs.

Classroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.

Students can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.

With the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their phone or tablet. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date. 

There are many benefits of using Classroom:

Easy to set up
Teachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.

Saves time
The simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.

Improves organization
Students can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.

Enhances communication
Classroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.

Affordable and secure
Like the rest of our Google Apps for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes, and is free for schools.Duolingo is Apple's iPhone App of the Year!

Learn Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Irish, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, and English. Totally fun. Totally free.

"Far and away the best language-learning app." —The Wall Street Journal

"Duolingo may hold the secret to the future of education."—TIME Magazine

PC Magazine Editors' Choice for Language Learning: "Among iPhone apps for learning or practicing a language, you can't beat Duolingo."

"The most productive means of procrastination I’ve ever discovered. The short lesson blocks are painless and peppy, and reaching the next level (and then the level after that) becomes addictive." —Slate

Duolingo is changing the way people learn languages.

With Duolingo, you learn a language completely for free. You have fun while you learn, leveling up and competing with friends.

Yeah, it's pretty sweet.Remind (formerly Remind101) is a free, safe, and simple way for teachers to communicate with students and parents. Send updates, questions, and more to any device—students and parents can receive notifications by text message, on the app, on the web, and by email. 

* Save time by sending quick, one-way announcements to an entire class.
* Reach individuals and small groups directly with instant, safe messages. 
* Personal phone numbers are never shared, and message history can be accessed at any time.

In one Harvard University study, frequent teacher-family communication increased the likelihood of homework completion by 42% and decreased instances of teacher redirection by 25%. Communication is critical to student success, and Remind can help teachers build strong relationships with students and their families.

If you love Remind, share the app with your colleagues or write a review!

BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK: “Jessica D, a teacher in Louisiana, uses Remind daily to brief parents on whether their children did well in class and what their homework is for the night. She says the app has led more students to complete their homework and even credits it with improving scores on standardized tests. “The word I use is ‘transform,’ ” she says. “It transformed my classroom. And I think it made me a better teacher.”

BUZZFEED: “...SMS allows the app to be used by parents without smartphones. Brett Kopf said that Remind’s features have proved especially popular in low-income districts, where parent engagement is a key issue for teachers, and parents’ sometimes erratic work schedules can make it difficult to get in touch by phone.”

Unlike most classroom management tools and behavior trackers like gold-star charts, ClassDojo helps teachers focus on positive feedback. Teachers can customize the behaviors or skills, such as “Working hard” and “Participating”, and instantly award students in class Dojo points for doing the right thing.

Teachers can also put different sets of students into groups, offering a simple way for teachers to award table points and foster a collaborative classroom culture.

Best of all, teachers can engage parents and provide them with a way to stay connected to the classroom and know how their child is doing. Parents can see their child’s feedback from school in real-time, and view any comments made by teachers. 

Teachers can broadcast a message to all parents (such as sharing a reminder, assignment, homework, or permission slip), and also send private, meaningful communications like text messages and photos so that parents are connected to the classroom without the hassle of emails and school newsletters.

Students can create their own accounts, customize their Dojo avatars, and self-reflect on their performance while in school or at home.

Unlike most classroom management organizers and class planners, ClassDojo can be used on any device: laptops, iPhones, iPads, tablets and phones, as well as smartboards - and it syncs seamlessly across all of them in real-time!

Scholly: Scholarship Search is an easy way for high school seniors, current undergraduates, and graduate students in the United States to find money for their education. Designed to ease the scholarship search process, Scholly’s adaptive matching engine delivers a smarter, targeted list of scholarships for each student. Unlike those behemoth search databases out there, we value quality over quantity of matched results. Scholly remedies the current outdated process which requires that each student fill out long, tiresome forms only to receive irrelevant, useless results.

Scholly's database consists of a list of scholarships curated by the Million Dollar Scholar himself. We don’t waste student’s time with random scholarships they don't qualify for nor do we populate our database with non-scholarship items like loans, internships, and advertisements. We update deadlines as soon as they are available and scholarships that no longer exist will be removed from our database.

Scholly is the first step in making the scholarship search process as simple as possible.

NEW IN STAR WALK 2

All-new stunning design:

DISCOVER NEW DEPTHS
Star Walk 2 is the first astronomy guide to introduce plausible three-dimensional models of planetary nebulae. Star groupings of the 88 officially recognized constellations are also presented in volume. You can see them as separate entities, turn them around and take a look from the other side. Complemented by articles on connected myths and history, this is the most comprehensive collection of information on constellations.*

REAL-TIME MOTION TRACKING
As you hold your phone up and point it towards the sky, Star Walk 2 follows your motions using the built-in gyroscope to match the map on your screen to the stars seen from your location. Easily find any star, constellation, or satellite in the sky by tapping Search. Star Walk will indicate the direction to look in. 

NEW POINT OF VIEW
Unlike on a plain photograph, every star in Star Walk 2 has coordinates. That means you can look at objects, for instance, a constellation from any vantage point in space, not to mention the ultimate accuracy of your map for your exact location. 

NOW AND LATER 
Star Walk 2 gives you accurate daily data on current moon phase, time of sunset and sunrise, and elevation of planets. With just one slide you can see how the sky will look later tonight or throughout the year. 

PRO STARGAZING
Special night-time soft red mode will help you preserve night vision when stargazing with a telescope. You can see the sky in X-Ray (and 5 more filters) to study the invisible structure of the universe. Live tracking for over 8,000 satellites will help you catch iridium flares, and detailed articles will satisfy the most curious inquirer.Welcome to ABCmouse.com - the #1 learning program for ages 2-7!

HONORS AND AWARDS
• TIME’s 50 Best Websites of the Year
• PC Magazine's Top 100 Websites of the Year
• Tech & Learning Award of Excellence
• Webby Awards: Official Honoree in EducationThis App is free and works with the Sponsored version of Budget Challenge named H&R Block Budget Challenge found on www.hrblock.budgetchallenge.com and contains features to support the scholarship contest for high school students.
 
Budget Challenge® is an award-winning and patented program that actually SHOWS young people how to manage money in a real life setting.  We use a Learning-By-Doing approach to put students in the driver’s seat in our Road Test for Personal Finance®.  Our contest simulations are 10 weeks in duration and students receive paychecks and bills in real time and are challenged to pay their bills and save money for retirement in a 401k.  Unlike other simulations, Budget Challenge is also a competition that scores and ranks students based on how well they save, answer weekly quizzes, and manage their financial responsibilities (pay bills).  Students can compete with other students in their class and classes can compete with other classes based on class average to make the learning of life skills engaging and fun.  

The simulation does not use real money, but is extremely realistic including features such as online bill pay, direct deposit, email bill alerts, 401k paycheck deductions and more.  Budget Challenge also includes many of the complicated banking and credit card fees that plague young people in the real world, so students can learn the ropes and make their costly ‘rookie’ mistakes in the safety of the classroom.  

Budget Challenge aims to make students Real World Ready by focusing on Behaviors, Knowledge, and Skills.  Our program aligns with NCEE and Jump$tart national standards and goes well beyond teaching vocabulary and financial concepts by putting these topics into action with real consequences.  This patented product delivers unparalleled results that really matter for students entering the real world.    The statistics below were from a study of over 25,000 students and were published on Time.com:

•	92% said learning about money management was very important and 80% wanted to learn more
•	92% said they were more likely to check their account balance before writing a check
•	89% said they were more confident and 91% said they were more aware of money pitfalls and mistakes
•	87% said they were better able to avoid bank and credit card fees
•	84% said they were better able to understand fine print and 79% said they were better able to compare financial products
•	78% said they learned money management methods that worked best for them
•	53% said they were rethinking their college major or career choice with an eye toward higher pay

While most of the core functionality of the website is contained in this app, there are limitations of small screens, so some content has been abridged or removed from the app.  For first time users, we recommend playing the simulation for a week or two on a PC/Mac before using the app exclusively.
